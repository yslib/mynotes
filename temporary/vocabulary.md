This is my note for my english listening practice. The video material is from Coach Shane, a english teacher
released his video on Youtube and Bilibili.

Listening is necessary, and dictation and pronounciation following the original sound is highly recommanded and you will yield the twice result with half effort.

You may known what they means more or less for some words, but you also need to pay attention to 
the usage under specified circumstance. For these words, I also put them in the section of 
New and key words. What's more, the listening sentence is a perfect example for learning these words.

The note can be viewed at broswer, you can use dictionary plugin of broswer to look up the words meaning.
