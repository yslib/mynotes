## The Big Bang

### Spectra and the Doppler Effect
A spectrum is a graph of flux per unit wavelength plotted against wavelength. It will often show emission or absorption lines due to particular elements.

If an object is moving towards or away from you, these spectral lines will be moved in wavelength away from their normal wavelength Œªo. If you observe a line at wavelength Œª, you can define a redshift z as:

$$
z = \frac{\lambda-\lambda_0}{\lambda_0}
$$

If this shift is due to the doppler effect, and the velocity $v\ll c$ (velocity much less than the speed of light - nearly always true), then:

$$
z = \frac{v}{c}
$$


### Hubble Law

Assuming that the brightest star in every galaxy had about the same luminosity (not a good assumption), Edwin Hubble calculated their relative distances. He found that the distances correlated with redshift. Everything was moving away from us and the speed correlated with how far things were from us.

The standard explanation is that space itself is expanding. Objects are not moving - they are just being carried apart by the expansion of space.

This means that unless more matter is created, the density of the universe must continuously go down (same amount of matter spread over more space). The alternative is that more matter is appearing out of nowhere - this is called the ‚Äústeady state theory‚Äù.

The ‚ÄúSteady State Theory‚Äù predicts that the universe should always look the same. We actually observe, however, that the universe was different in the past (we can see the past by looking a distant objects). Quasars were more common and the microwave background emission comes from a time when space was opaque.

### Peculiar Motions

If galaxies did not have any mass, and space was expanding fast, then every galaxy would move away from us, and their redshift would be proportional to their distance. But in reality, galaxies have mass, and their gravity pulls them towards each other.  These motions due to gravity attracting neighbouring galaxies are called peculiar motions (peculiar because they do not fit in with the Hubble Law). The observed motion of galaxies is the combination of the Hubble Law (due to the expansion of the universe) and the peculiar motions.

When galaxies are close together, their mutual gravity is strong, and the amount of space to expand between them is weak. In this case, gravity can overcome the expansion and suck the galaxies together. Our own Milky Way galaxy and the nearby Andromeda Galaxy (M31) are being sucked together by their mutual gravity and will ultimately collide. But when galaxies are further apart, their gravitational attraction is weaker and there is more space between them to expand: in this case the expansion will win.

### Scale Factor

Redshit $z$ is given by:
$$
z = (1-a(t))/a(t)
$$

or alternatively:
$$
a(t) = 1/(1+z)
$$

### Density and energy evolution
The present-day mean energy of photons (the microwave background) is around  $10^{-3}eV$ (an eV is an electron volt = $1.6√ó10^{‚àí19}J$, defined as the energy an electroc acquires when accelerated across a one volt potential difference).

At some point in the past, the energy would be:

### Microwave Background
At redshifts before around 1000, a fraction of photons had enough energy (13.6 eV) to knock the electrons off hydrogen atoms. Ionised hydrogen (hydrogen with its electrons knocked off) scatters light very strongly - so it would look like a glowing fog. Back then photons would be trapped bouncing between the atoms. Once the universe cooled down enough for the electrons to "recombine" with their nuclei, the universe became transparent and the photons have been flying freely in all directions ever since. This sea of photons is the observed microwave background.

### Primordial nucleosynthesis

Neutrons have a half-life of 887 seconds when not locked securely away inside a nucleus. So if there had not been nuclear fusion in the first few minutes of the universe, the neutrons would have gone away.

Nuclear fusion didn't start earlier because most reactions start with deuterium, and in the first 90 seconds, photons have enough energy to blow deuterium apart (the "Deuterium Bottleneck").

The primordial nuclear reactions produced a universe of 25% Helium and 75% Hydrogen, plus trace amounts of Lithium and Deuterium.

### Structure FOrmation and antimatter

The microwave background is extremely uniform - fluctuations of only one part in 100,000. Gravitational instability turned that very smooth universe into the lumpy one we see today. These tiny fluctuations probably came from quantum fluctuations when the universe was VERY young. These were somehow amplified up to the sizes of galaxy super-clusters. We don't know why the fluctations are the size we observe.

We also don't know why there is such a large imbalance between matter and antimatter in our universe.



### Age of Universe
If you assume that space is expanding at a uniform pace, you can estimate the age of the universe.

One way is to look at an object at distance D, with redshift z. Its motion away from us is cz (speed of light times the redshift). So if you extrapolate backwards, it must have been right here on Earth a time  ùë°=ùê∑ùëêùëß  ago.

An alternative way to think about it is that when light set out from an object at redshift z, the universe had a scale factor 
$ùëé(ùë°)=\frac{1}/{1+ùëß}$ . The time t is just $\frac{D}{c}$. So if (for example) the scale factor 1 billion years ago was 0.9, then if the expansion was steady, the scale factor would have been 0 at a point in time ten billion years ago.

Some objects were discovered that seemed, according to this theory, to be older than the universe. A universe that started off expanding fast then decelerated would make this worse.
